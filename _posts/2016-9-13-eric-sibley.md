### Tell us about yourself and your work.

I'm 28 years old and grew up in New York. I've worked in the film industry since I was 20 doing visual effects for both Hollywood blockbusters and hit TV series. I enjoy all things related to film and am an avid fan of the arts.

### How do you define success? Do you think you're there yet?

To me there is no one way to define success, and I think it's a very personal quest. I am always striving for more and thinking about the next step, but I am also proud of all I've accomplished already. We all have dreams in some form or another, and I consider myself successful if I am making a consistent and focused effort to pursue them. I find I am the most happy when I know I am trying to move forward and not growing complacent.

### What difficulties did you face at the beginning of your career? What did you do to stand out?

The old "getting your foot in the door" is one of the most challenging things in your career. For me, that involved continually updating my reel with personal projects showcasing improved technical and artistic skills as well as networking. After finishing my second reel out of college, I bit the bullet and went to SIGGRAPH. I did the job convention and the only real bite I got was doing stereo conversion. It wasn't ideal, but it was a foot in the door. At that job I continued to build my reel, and continued networking, which once you have a few industry friends just meant getting drunk with other VFX nerds. From there I worked my way out of the conversion scene up to some of the best visual effects houses in the world. Just put yourself out there and continue to grow your network. You may have gotten your foot in the door, but I bet there are several doors in that room you want to get your foot into next.

### What are some common misconceptions that beginners have about the industry?

I think we all are inspired by awesome breakdowns from our favorite movies and shows and think, I want to do that! However, most people don't realize it is a large team of people contributing very specific skill sets. It is a long and sometimes painful process. You're sometimes stuck late at night doing multiple versions, making ridiculous changes, most of which will never see the light of day. It takes tons of work to sculpt a shot, it is never as easy as those "before and after" wipes make them seem.

### Do you have any rules or habits that help you stay creative and/or productive?

I find most of my inspiration through other artists. Whether that's reading a book, seeing a film, watching a reel online or browsing concept art. There is something you can take away and learn from all art forms and I try to channel that into something creative.

### What does the future look like for you?

I am currently directing two short films. Both of which were probably way too ambitious for one person to take on. I am hoping to have them both finished up in the beginning of 2018 and then work on launching my own production studio with the focus on putting a creative team together to produce a feature.
