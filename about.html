  <h1>What is Primitive Artists?</h1>
  <p>Primitive Artists is an interview series featuring 3D artists in the animation, film, and game industries. We interview artists in hopes of spreading ideas, building inspiration, understanding our industry, and most importantly, promoting a culture of community.</p>
  <p>Our industry is small, the businesses are stumbling, the job market is competitive, the pay isn’t, and yet we are all here. We are in this together. We each have a voice. And we can learn from each other.</p>
  <p>Together, we can uncover answers to the big questions. What motivates us to get out of bed each morning and what keeps us squinting at the computer screen late into the night? What do we do if that motivation is gone? Why are some artists more successful than others? Is it raw talent, persistence, hard work, a bottomless muse, or some complex amalgamation of all of these characteristics? Where is the industry headed as a whole and what is our role in it?</p>
  <p>We’ve all seen their work. Now let’s get to know the talented artists behind the portfolio.</p>
  <p>We would love to hear your feedback. If you have questions you’d like us to ask, or have suggestions for an artist you’d like to hear from, let us know. And don’t forget to keep the conversation going in the comments section.</p>
  <p>A big thank you to all artists who interviewed with us. They took time away from their jobs and families to talk to us. Show your support for their work by visiting their portfolios.</p>
